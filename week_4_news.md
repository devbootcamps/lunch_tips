# Tuesday Lunch Tip: Take one step back

Hi **first_name**,

Whoops, I totally forgot to send you a new Tuesday Lunch Tip for the last two weeks! You must feel really hungry for knowledge by now. This time I've got something really nice and big for you to chew on, as we take one step back from programming and [dive deep into the underlying world of the terminal][1], or UNIX.

This might be a little hard to digest for you Windows users, but luckily there's [a solution for that][2]

Enjoy your lunch and see you next week (promised)!
