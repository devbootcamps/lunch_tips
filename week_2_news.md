# Tuesday Lunch Tip: Let's get it started!

Hi **first_name**,

I hope you had a good warming with last weeks [Ruby primer][1], because this week we will get serious. I've selected another great Ruby learning resource for you, but this time it's going to be a bit harder then just reading. We're going to [write some real code][2]!

You're gonna do that using CodeSchools great [Try Ruby track][4]. You can run it from your browser, so no installation of stuff on your machine (yet). I personally like the way it handles many different subjects and gives you a great feedback loop while actually writing code. You should give it a try!

Do you like this so far? Are you ready for more? Then [order your ticket][3] for Development Bootcamp in Amsterdam, before it's too late. Or wait until next week for a new edition of Tuesday Lunch Tips.

Enjoy your lunch and see you next week!
