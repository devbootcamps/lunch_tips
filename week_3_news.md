# Tuesday Lunch Tip: The Path to Enlightenment

Hi **first_name**,

Yes, it's that time of the week again. This week I like to keep it short, so nothing will stand in your way on the path to enlightenment.

Read [our blog post][2] about [RubyKoans][1] and how it helps you to understand the syntax and culture of Ruby. I really loved these exercises when I was learning Ruby.

Do you like this so far? Are you ready for more? Then [order your ticket][3] for Development Bootcamp in Amsterdam, before it's too late. Or wait until next week for a new edition of Tuesday Lunch Tips.

Enjoy your lunch and see you next week!
