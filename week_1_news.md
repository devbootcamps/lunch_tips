subject: Tuesday's Lunch Tip: Always test your code!

Hi **first_name**,

It's only 5 more months until Development Bootcamp kicks off! But we got many messages from you saying you couldn't wait that long and wanted some coding exercises so you can come prepared. We're very lucky to have students like you!

That's why I'm sending you a weekly newsletter with a tip to online learning material. This is the first edition, and I'll send it out every tuesday at lunch time, so you can ease your craving for code!

Let me start with a funny story: we broke our own website! There was a little bug in our ticketing system preventing students from finishing the checkout process and thus not being able to get a ticket for Development Bootcamp. A very valuable lesson, for experienced and inexperienced developers alike: always test your code!

But before you can test your code, you need to be able to write it. I've found a great primer on Ruby for you to have a look at. It's written by Japanese monks, so it must give you some peace of mind while learning to code.

And for the bug on our website? We fixed it immediately so you can now [get your ticket][1] before it's too late. And of course we've added some tests to our code, so this can never happen again.

Are you ready to start your coding adventure? Read [our blog post][2] or dive right into [the Ruby primer by Rubymonk][3].

Enjoy your lunch!
