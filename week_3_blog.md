# Tuesday Lunch Tip: The Path to Enlightenment

This is the third installment of a new category on our blog: the tuesday lunch tip. Every tuesday around lunch time we will publish one or more links to learning materials online, so you can fulfil your craving for code. Subscribers to [our newsletter][6] will be first to know when a new post is published, so [subscribe now][6] if you want to be up-to-date. Or follow us on [twitter][7] or [Facebook][8] if you don't like email.

In this week, you should feel comfortable with the Ruby language. The best way to learn how to program is to be confronted with some problems that you need to solve. It forces you to think creatively and apply your new found knowledge to a real problem!

When I was learning Ruby and wanted to dive a little deeper, I was very happy to find a site called [RubyKoans][1], which walks you along the path to enlightenment in order to learn Ruby. It will teach you all about the Ruby language, structures, common functions and more importantly, the Ruby culture.

Download the koans and try to run each of them. It will give you a problem, which you need to solve. The cool thing is, that you'll not only learn programming in Ruby, but also get a first glimpse of test-driven development. A very useful technique to become a better programmer.

Good luck and see you next week!
