# Tuesday Lunch Tip: Let's get it started!

This is the second installment of a new category on our blog: the tuesday lunch tip. Every tuesday around lunch time we will publish one or more links to learning materials online, so you can fulfil your craving for code. Subscribers to [our newsletter][6] will be first to know when a new post is published, so [subscribe now][6] if you want to be up-to-date. Or follow us on [twitter][7] or [Facebook][8] if you don't like email.

Last week we let you [warm up a bit][2] with the excellent [Ruby primer by Ruby Monks][1]. I hope it got you fired up to try some more this week!

This week I want you to go out there, move fast and break things. Please be careful for your grandmothers china: you're going to write some real code!

The best thing is - you don't need to install anything. [CodeSchool.com][3] offers different courses that you can run from your browser. What's even better, you get feedback right away on you're doing! I personally love this style of learning, because it gives you a great and quick feedback loop without needing to much prior knowledge to set things up. We'll get there, eventually.

The course I've picked for you this time is the [Try Ruby course][4]. You'll start with the very basics in Lesson One (if you read last weeks primer carefully, you probably know most of this already) but soon enough you're in Lesson Six building and using your own library (see it as a nice grab bag of useful functions). That's pretty cool, so better get going right now!

Good luck and see you next week!
