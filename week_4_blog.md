# Tuesday Lunch Tip: Take one step back

This is the fourth installment of a new category on our blog: the tuesday lunch tip. Every tuesday around lunch time we will publish one or more links to learning materials online, so you can fulfil your craving for code. Subscribers to [our newsletter][6] will be first to know when a new post is published, so [subscribe now][6] if you want to be up-to-date. Or follow us on [twitter][7] or [Facebook][8] if you don't like email.

Hey Bootcampers. Sorry for not looking after you for almost two weeks. I'll try to make it up to you this week by showing you [this really nice explanation of UNIX][1] written by Oliver Elliot. It covers almost all questions you can have when you first encounter that strange world of the terminal (or the Matrix as so of my non-technical co-workers refer to it).

When you're programming you end up doing a lot a the terminal, so a good understanding of the power of the terminal and how you can use it is essential to becoming proficient in programming. My moment of appreciation for the terminal was in university when I asked one of the teaching assistent how to grab some 1000 random lines from a text file and he responded with a one-liner I could execute on the terminal. These days I find myself many times using the terminal for small one-off jobs like checking the number of lines in a file, filtering duplicates, etc.

I hope you'll have a similar epiphany this week reading through this article.

Oh, and for our dear Windows readers, please check out [CygWin][2]. Windows doesn't come with a powerful terminal environment like on Unix (although there's [PowerShell][3]), but with CygWin you can emulate a UNIX shell on your windows laptop.

(If you're really eager to run a UNIX-like environment on your Windows machine, you could always run something like [Ubuntu in a virtual machine][4], but that might be a little bit too advanced for now.)
